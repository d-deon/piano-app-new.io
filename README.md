# piano_intervals_app
This app is meant to train your ear within the art of interval recognition
I initially planned it as having another page of testing where you would have a randomiser 
that would test you on your newly gained knowledge.
That is still to come, as I really enjoyed working and succeding to create this app.
I will take this further after the entry "exam", that is why the piano_test.html css and js exists in the repository. 
I have however commented it out of the main menu as it is not ready yet.
The piano is fully functional and the learning page will give you all the tools necessary for a good learning experience. ðŸŽ¶âœ¨

Happy interval learning!

Did you know all the songs? :)
